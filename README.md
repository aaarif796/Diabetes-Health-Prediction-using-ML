# 🩺 Diabetes Health Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict diabetes using various health indicators. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation, leveraging supervised learning algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [CDC Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset (UCI Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+health+indicators+dataset)
- **Features**: Includes BMI, smoking status, physical health, mental health, sleep time, age, and more.
- **Target**: Binary indicator of diabetes status.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   Load the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Use seaborn/matplotlib to visualize data distribution and correlations.

3. **Feature Selection and Engineering**  
   Normalize and encode features if necessary.

4. **Model Building**  
   Train multiple models including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

6. **Final Remarks**  
   Discuss strengths, limitations, and potential improvements (e.g., handling class imbalance, feature importance).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
